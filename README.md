Service Bus - Deadletting Simulator
===========================
This simulator helps you illustrate how the expiration of messages in Service Bus happens.

You can read more about it in my blog post [here](http://tomkerkhove.ghost.io/2015/01/07/automatically-dead-letter-expired-messages-in-azure-service-bus-how-it-works/)

## Example - Service Bus for Windows Server ##
In this screenshot you can see that the message will only expire after you called the Receive()-method.
